    File Description:  This file is the CSS file used to style the content in the HTML file index.html. The form on this webpage is styled using Bootstrap as well as CSS. The main theme of the page is grey with a large red button for generating the table. The form is centered along with the rest of the content, including the table. Bootstrap is also used in the HTML file to style the display based on different screen sizes and columns. In order to style the table, the nth-child() pseudo-class is used so that the first row and column of the table is different from the rest of the table. The table itself is styled in bold lettering with thicker border lines for easier readability. The text is a dark color with lighter background so it stands out.
